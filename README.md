# CMPG_323_Overview-26934620
This is a repository for the implementation of the Agile and Scrum frameworks.
This project is for the module CMPG323 and consists of five Projects and at the end a POE (Portfolio of Evidence).

### Here follows the URLs of the other Projects repos:
- Project 2 (API Development): https://github.com/Christine-Liebie/CMPG_323_Project2-26934620
- Project 3 (Standards & Patterns): https://github.com/Christine-Liebie/CMPG_323_Project3-26934620
- Project 4 (Testing & RPA): https://github.com/Christine-Liebie/CMPG_323_Project4-26934620
- Project 5 (Reporting Monitoring): https://github.com/Christine-Liebie/CMPG_323_Project5-26934620

### This is a representation of how the Project and Repositories will fit in together:

### Branching strategies:
Each project will use two branches namely main and dev.
- main (the current working program): indicates the working project
- dev (where development will take place): indicates that development is currently taking place

After a branch under dev is completed, it will then be merged into the main branch.

### Credentials and sensitive info storage:
This information will be added to .gitignore files (files that will be ignored when they are uploaded to the repo).
